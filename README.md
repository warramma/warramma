## Projects you can find here:
### [_Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network_](https://github.com/warramma/Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network)
This project follows the complete machine learning lifecycle to predict the sentiment of book reviews. I implemented and evaluated a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network, comparing their performance on a binary classification task. The project involved:
- Text preprocessing using gensim and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Data cleaning to handle duplicates and ensure class balance.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Comprehensive documentation of the methodology, results, and key findings.
  
**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
### [_HoodWatch_](https://github.com/mrchow330/Neighborhood-Safety-App)
This was a team effort. As the front end lead for this project, I was responsible for designing the look in `Figma` & implementing the design, as well as setting up and maintaining the Expo app project. I managed front end tasks and delegated them to other team members as needed. I also did the majority of the login & account features, setting up authentication and email verification, which also involved working on the backend ➡️[backend repo](https://github.com/mrchow330/neighborhood-safety-backend).

**Languages & Frameworks**: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `React`, `Expo`
