### Hi all! This is Wardiyah! Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

Some info on my current Top 6 repos:

- Leetcode - **Python** - a repo where I save and sort all my leetcode solutions with custom tags for easy revision.
- Web102 prework - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - I recently applied for CodePathâ€™s technical courses and was accepted into both Intermediate Web Development with React and the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course. I had a lot of fun solving their web development prework challenges to filter through data and implementing a search feature.
- Bismillah Project - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - a dynamic website advocating for better Muslim representation implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recognized for creativity and technical proficiency and received first place in the congressional app challenge
