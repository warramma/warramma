### Hi all! This is Wardiyah! On the internet, I also go by diyahramma or Warramma 😉 Welcome to my little corner on GitHub!

- ⚒️ These days I'm focusing my attention on double majoring in **Math and Computer Science**. On my own time, I love delving into *data science and web development*. I'm currently working through the TOP Javascript track, online courses on Python and Data Science Fundamentals, strengthening my math skills and other personal projects (available below ⬇️). This past June, I finished up an amazing experience working as a Data Science Instructor Assistant for the Kode With Klossy Data Science summer camp.
