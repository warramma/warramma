### Hi all! This is Wardiyah! Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

- ⚒️ These days I'm focusing my attention on double majoring in **Math and Computer Science**. On my own time, I love delving into *data science and web development*. I'm currently working through the TOP Foundations track, FreeCodeCamp courses, strengthening my math skills, and other personal projects (available below ⬇️). This past June, I finished up an amazing experience working as a Data Science Instructor Assistant for the Kode With Klossy Data Science summer camp.
