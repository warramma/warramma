## Highlighted Projects

### [_WiDS Datathon 2026: Physics-Informed Fire Spread Prediction_](https://github.com/warramma/WiDS-Datathon-2026)
Predicting the probability of wildfire impact across 12h, 24h, 48h, and 72h horizons using survival analysis and ensemble learning.
- **Physics-Informed Engineering:** Created domain-specific features like **Wavefront ETA** (combining radial growth and movement) and **Near-Miss Margin** to capture fire dynamics.
- **The Blend:** Implemented a hybrid ensemble of **Random Survival Forests (RSF)** and Gradient Boosting (XGB/LGB/Cat), achieving a localized **Brier Score of 0.003**.
- **Statistical Rigor:** Managed right-censored data and ensured logical consistency through **monotonicity constraints** and 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation.
- **Impact:** Ranked in the **Top 25%** of Break Through Tech program teams.

**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `Scikit-Survival`, `XGBoost`, `Optuna`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

### [_Entrepreneur Compass Tool - Cambio Labs_](https://github.com/warramma/Fall_AI_Studio)
Developed as part of the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/), this project automates resource matching for low-income social entrepreneurs.
- **Problem:** Small business owners waste significant time manually searching for localized growth resources.
- **Solution:** Built a scalable recommendation system using **Random Forest and KNN** (most accurate) to match demographic data to high-impact resources.
- **Data & Features:** Engineered features from technology access and income levels; used **NLP** on open-ended responses for deeper categorization.

**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`

### [_HoodWatch_](https://github.com/mrchow330/Neighborhood-Safety-App)
A collaborative neighborhood safety application. 
- **Lead Role:** Served as Frontend Lead, designing the UI/UX in **Figma** and implementing the architecture in **Expo/React Native**.
- **Fullstack Contributions:** Managed user authentication, email verification, and backend integration for account management.

**Languages & Frameworks**: `TypeScript`, `React Native`, `Expo`, `Node.js`
