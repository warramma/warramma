# Hi, I'm Wardiyah! _Selamat Datang_ (Welcome) to my corner on GitHub
**I'm a sophomore at Bradley University double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics, passionate about data driven software engineering.** 
I discovered my passion for technology my junior year of highschool and since then, I’ve dedicated my time to learning as much as I can. Through my personal projects, classes, and extracurriculars, I love exploring technology’s potential for creativity and positive impact. Through my involvement in Society of Women Engineers, Kode With Klossy, and Rewriting the Code, I aim to educate myself and empower other women in tech.

Because of my interest in math, I’ve focused my electives on Data Science topics. Beyond Data Science, I also enjoy Web Development and am currently working through the Odin Project’s Full Stack JavaScript Path.

When I'm not looking up documentation, I also enjoy reading, crocheting, journaling, language learning, and spending time with family.

- [_CodingBat Python Solutions_](https://github.com/warramma/codingbat_python)  & [_Edabit Solutions_](https://github.com/warramma/Edabit_solutions)- **Python** - practicing my Python to prep for technical interviews and to support my data science interests
- [_learning_webdev_](https://github.com/warramma/learning_webdev) - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - a collection of different web development practices from Tables to manipulating the DOM as part of my journey with the Odin Project
- [_Etch-a-sketch_](https://github.com/warramma/etch_a_sketch) - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - This colorful sketchpad was a joy to make and I thank the Odin Project contributors for giving me the push to make it! Although it was challenging to arrange the squares with Flexbox instead of CSS Grid, I was able to figure it out by asking the right questions and I love how it turned out.
