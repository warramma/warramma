### [_Entrepreneur Compass Tool - Cambio Labs_](https://github.com/warramma/Fall_AI_Studio)
This project, developed as part of the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/) for [Cambio Labs](https://www.cambiolabs.org/), focuses on transforming data into tailored resource recommendations for low-income social entrepreneurs. Our goal was to streamline Cambio Labs' workflow and increase the success rate of small business owners by automating and scaling resource matching.
#### Key Highlights
- **Problem:** Small business owners, predominantly in the early stages and from low-income communities, waste time manually searching for resources.
- **Solution:** Developing and evaluating Machine Learning models for a scalable resource recommendation system, transforming demographic and entrepreneurial data into direct, impactful resource matches.
- **Modeling:** Extensive testing of several models, including Random Forest, KNN (most accurate), and a Simplified DNN. We found Random Forest/KNN to be the suggested production models, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.
- **Data & Features:** The final model features were tied to technology access, education, employment, income level, and interest in entrepreneurship. Feature Engineering involved NLP on open-ended responses, one-hot encoding, and feature selection via Logistic Regression.
- **Impact:** The findings position Cambio Labs to create a user-friendly tool that provides a simplified, informative onboarding experience and targets a broader group of entrepreneurs.
  
**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`

### [_Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network_](https://github.com/warramma/Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network)
This project follows the complete machine learning lifecycle to predict the sentiment of book reviews. I implemented and evaluated a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network, comparing their performance on a binary classification task. The project involved:
- Text preprocessing using gensim and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Data cleaning to handle duplicates and ensure class balance.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Comprehensive documentation of the methodology, results, and key findings.
  
**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### [_HoodWatch_](https://github.com/mrchow330/Neighborhood-Safety-App)
This was a team effort. As the front end lead for this project, I was responsible for designing the look in `Figma` & implementing the design, as well as setting up and maintaining the Expo app project. I managed front end tasks and delegated them to other team members as needed. I also did the majority of the login & account features, setting up authentication and email verification, which also involved working on the backend ➡️[backend repo](https://github.com/mrchow330/neighborhood-safety-backend).

**Languages & Frameworks**: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `React`, `Expo`
