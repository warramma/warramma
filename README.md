## Projects
Notable past work:
- [_Bismillah Project_](https://warramma.github.io/bismillah-twopointoh/) - bismillah is a site I made to advocate for better Muslim representation, as well as promote Muslim voices. The site features various informational content including important vocabulary, essays on Muslim representation, a database of Muslim voices, resources, and more. This project won first place for my district in the [Congressional App Challenge in 2022](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/22-il18/).

Although it was challenging to arrange the squares with Flexbox instead of CSS Grid, I was able to figure it out by asking the right questions and I love how it turned out.
