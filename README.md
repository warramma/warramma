### Hi all! This is Wardiyah, or Warramma, welcome to my little corner on GitHub!

- ⚒️ These days I'm focusing my attention on my website **Swarrammalt**, which stands for Stuff Warramma Learned Today. It's still in the works. The plan is for a blog style site where I post the most recent things I've learned, mainly about CS and Math, but also random other things. I also use Swarrammalt to practice any new webdev stuff I'm learning. 
- 🏫 I’m currently in school for CS and Math. On my own time, I love delving into data science and web development. I'm currently working through TOP JavaScript track and looking forward to learning more about Python and SQL
- 💬 Ask me about inferential stats, western civilizations, linear algebra, webdev, and anything else! 
- 📫 How to reach me: rammazy.wardiyah@gmail.com is the fastest way to reach me :) 
- 💗 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌹 Fun fact: Ramadan is not a festival or celebration per se, it's a holy month, not the Muslim christmas :)

**always always, Free Palestine 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸**
