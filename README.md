### Hi all! This is Wardiyah, or Warramma, welcome to my little corner on GitHub!

- ⚒️ These days I'm focusing my attention on double majoring in **Math and Computer Science**. On my own time, I love delving into *data science and web development*. I'm currently working through the TOP Javascript track, online courses on Python and Data Science Fundamentals, as well as teaching as an Instructor Assistant for the Kode With Klossy Data Science summer camp. 
- 💬 Ask me about inferential stats, western civilization, linear algebra, webdev, and anything else!
