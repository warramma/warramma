## Projects
Most recent major project I've worked on:
- [_HoodWatch_](https://github.com/mrchow330/Neighborhood-Safety-App) - This was a team effort. I was responsible for a lot of the front end for the main app, designing the look in Figma, as well as setting up and maintaining the Expo app project. I managed front end tasks and delegated them to other team members as needed. I also did majority of the login feature, setting up authentication and email verification.
  
### Notable repos:

- [_nulladiesinelinea_](https://github.com/warramma/nulladiessinelinea/tree/main) - This repo is a record and collective repository of different projects, practice, and things I've learned in order to always code a line a day based on the principle *Nulla dies sine linea* (of code). 
- [_Bismillah Project_](https://warramma.github.io/bismillah-twopointoh/) - bismillah is a site I made to advocate for better Muslim representation, as well as promote Muslim voices. The site features various informational content including important vocabulary, essays on Muslim representation, a database of Muslim voices, resources, and more. This project won first place for my district in the [Congressional App Challenge in 2022](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/22-il18/).
