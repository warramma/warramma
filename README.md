### Hi all! This is Wardiyah! Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

I host the majority of my personal coding pursuits right here. If I'm not reviewing coursework, trying challenges, or solving LeetCode, I'm usually learning more about web development from following the Odin Project's FullStack JavaScript course and implementing what I learn in my own personal projects.

Some info on my current Top 6 repos:
- Learning malay - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** = Spent a year compiling free resources and researching language-learning to create and continuously update a learning hub for Malay, a lesser taught language.
- Leetcode - **Python** - a repo where I save and sort all my leetcode solutions with custom tags for easy revision.
- Datastructures with Java - **Java** - reviewing classic data structures such as stacks, queues and lists from my intro to data structures and algorithms class.
- Web102 prework - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - I recently applied for CodePathâ€™s technical courses and was accepted into both Intermediate Web Development with React and the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course. I had a lot of fun solving their web development prework challenges to filter through data and implementing a search feature.
- Calculator - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - Completed this classic CS rite of passage as my final project in the Odin Projects Foundations of Web Development Course. I had a lot of fun putting my JavaScript to work and honing my HTML and CSS
- Bismillah Project - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - a dynamic website advocating for better Muslim representation implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recognized for creativity and technical proficiency and received first place in the congressional app challenge
