# About Me
Currently I am a web development intern at [Levi, Ray, & Shoup, Inc.](https://www.lrswebsolutions.com/) and a fellow in [Break Through Tech's AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/). I'm passionate about growth and building impactful technology.
Apart from coding, I also casually post articles about tech and math on my newsletter **Dev-o-Ramma** which you can find at [devoramma.substack.com](https://devoramma.substack.com/)

## Languages, Tools, & Technologies
**Programming Languages/Frameworks:** Java, C++, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Python, R, SQL, Blazor, .NET, React, Expo

**Tools & Technologies:** Google Colab, Looker Studio, Git, Visual Studio, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, Azure DevOps

**Other Technical Skills:** Command Line/Powershell, Data Cleaning and Visualization, Machine Learning, Web Development, AI

## Projects you can find here:
### [_Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network_](https://github.com/warramma/Review-Sentiment-Regression-Neural-Network)
This project follows the complete machine learning lifecycle to predict the sentiment of book reviews. I implemented and evaluated a Logistic Regression model and a Neural Network, comparing their performance on a binary classification task. The project involved:
- Text preprocessing using gensim and TF-IDF vectorization.
- Data cleaning to handle duplicates and ensure class balance.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Comprehensive documentation of the methodology, results, and key findings.
**Languages & Libraries:** `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
### [_HoodWatch_](https://github.com/mrchow330/Neighborhood-Safety-App)
This was a team effort. As the front end lead for this project, I was responsible for designing the look in `Figma` & implementing the design, as well as setting up and maintaining the Expo app project. I managed front end tasks and delegated them to other team members as needed. I also did the majority of the login & account features, setting up authentication and email verification, which also involved working on the backend ➡️[backend repo](https://github.com/mrchow330/neighborhood-safety-backend).

**Languages & Frameworks**: `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `React`, `Expo`
  
## Other notable repos:

- [_nulladiesinelinea_](https://github.com/warramma/nulladiessinelinea/tree/main) - This repo is a record and collective repository of different projects, practice, and things I've learned in order to always code a line a day based on the principle *Nulla dies sine linea* (of code). 
- [_Bismillah Project_](https://warramma.github.io/bismillah-twopointoh/) - bismillah is a site I made to advocate for better Muslim representation, as well as promote Muslim voices. The site features various informational content including important vocabulary, essays on Muslim representation, a database of Muslim voices, resources, and more. This project won first place for my district in the [Congressional App Challenge in 2022](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/22-il18/).
