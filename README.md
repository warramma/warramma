### Hi all! This is Wardiyah! Welcome to my corner on GitHub!

I host the majority of my personal coding pursuits right here. If I'm not reviewing coursework, trying challenges, or solving LeetCode problems, I'm usually learning more about web development from following the Odin Project's FullStack JavaScript course and implementing what I learn in my own personal projects.

Some info on my current Top 6 repos:
- _Learning malay_ - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - Spent a year compiling free resources and researching language-learning to create and continuously update a learning hub for Malay, a lesser taught language.
- _Leetcode_ - **Python** - a repo where I save and sort all my leetcode solutions with custom tags for easy revision.
- _CodingBat Python Solutions_ - **Python** - practicing my Python to prep for technical interviews and to support my data science interests
- _Datastructures with Java_ - **Java** - reviewing classic data structures such as stacks, queues and lists from my intro to data structures and algorithms class.
- _Web102 prework_ - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - I recently applied for CodePathâ€™s technical courses and was accepted into both Intermediate Web Development with React and the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course. I had a lot of fun solving their web development prework challenges to filter through data and implementing a search feature.
- _Etch-a-sketch_ - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - This colorful sketchpad was a joy to make and I thank the Odin Project contributors for giving me the push to make it! Although it was challenging to arrange the squares with Flexbox instead of CSS Grid, I was able to figure it out by asking the right questions and I love how it turned out.
